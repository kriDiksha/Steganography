Image Steganography Using LSB Technique

A simple Python-based steganography project that hides a secret message and passcode in an image using Least-Significant-Bit (LSB) encoding, and later retrieves the message securely.
Overview

This project uses robust LSB steganography to embed a secret message along with a passcode into an image. It consists of two Python scripts with user-friendly GUIs built using Tkinter.
Features

    Encryption:
    Embeds a secret message and passcode into mypic.jpg and saves the result as encrypted.png.

    Decryption:
    Retrieves the hidden message from encrypted.png when the correct passcode is provided.

    User-Friendly GUI:
    Easy-to-use interfaces for both encryption and decryption processes.

    Robust Data Storage:
    Uses a header to store the lengths of the passcode and message for accurate extraction.

Requirements

    Python 3.x
    OpenCV
    NumPy
    Tkinter (usually included with Python)

Installation
